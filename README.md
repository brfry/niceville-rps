This repository consists of my first real attempt at making use of github. I have a small project I am working on, and am in the process of finalizing code. 

known issues with data set and analysis:
- skewed data, spatial auto-correlation. percentages.
- simple linear regression model was used but am evaluating the appropriateness of other models.
